Hello, my name is Bako, and welcome to my website! 

I have been a language teacher in Mandritsara since 2008. Over the years, I have personally tutored many missionaries and visitors to the [Hopitaly Vaovao Mahafaly Mandritsara](https://www.mandritsara.org.uk/) project.

In Mandritsara, the local Tsimihety people have their own dialect. However, official Malagasy language is widely spoken and understood by most people. 

It is my firm belief that language and culture are intertwined. Understanding context is crucial to mastering Malagasy/Tsimihety, conversely, the language itself provides a window into the heart and soul of the people. 

I thank God for this unique opportunity to teach the language, despite my lack of teaching qualification. I am a scientist by training. My teaching method has been refined through years of careful study and observation, with plenty of helpful feedback from my students.

This website is my attempt at committing to paper what I have gleaned over the years. Through these prepared lessons, I hope to provide a framework that will help future students master both Malagasy and Tsimihety. 

Note to the learner: these lessons are prepared in PDF format with audio clips included. 
If you are using adobe acrobat or compatible software, you can listen to the audio clips offline, otherwise, please click on the sound icon which will open up a separate browser to play the audio clip from the cloud.
